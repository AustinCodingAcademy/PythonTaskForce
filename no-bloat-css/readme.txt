No Bloat CSS is a script with the following goals:

1. Gather a list of all CSS styles in the stylesheet(s).  ** Currently built purely for bootstrap.css **
2. Check all the site's code to see which styles are used for the site.
3. Compare all styles used on the site vs the styles in the CSS style sheet.
4. Save master copy of the bootstrap.css and edit a new bootstrap file.
